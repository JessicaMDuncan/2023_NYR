Code and slides from 2023 NYR presentation: Give Credit Where Credit Is Due, Data Driven Approach to Marketing Attribution

Slides were presented at the 2023 NYR Conference in New York on July 13, 2023. A video recording of the presentation will be made available later this year at rstats.ai; I will link the video here once available.

The R code file contains everything you should need to reproduce the output demonstrated at the conference. The .pdf file is a copy of the slides presented during the conference itself.
